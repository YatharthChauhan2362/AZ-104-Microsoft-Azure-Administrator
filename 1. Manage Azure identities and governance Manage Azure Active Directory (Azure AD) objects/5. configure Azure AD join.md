To configure Azure AD join in Azure, you can follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com) with your Azure AD administrator account.
    
2.  In the left-hand menu, select "Azure Active Directory."
    
3.  In the Azure Active Directory blade, select "Devices" and then "Device settings."
    
4.  In the "Device settings" blade, under the "Azure AD join" section, configure the following settings:
    
    *   Set "Users may join devices to Azure AD" to "All" or "Selected" depending on your organization's requirements. If you choose "Selected," you'll need to specify the specific users or groups allowed to join devices.
    *   Choose the desired "Device type restrictions" if you want to restrict the type of devices that can join Azure AD, such as Windows devices, macOS devices, or both.
    *   Set "Require Multi-Factor Authentication" to "Yes" if you want to enforce MFA for device registration.
    *   Configure the "Join to Azure AD as" setting. Options include "Hybrid Azure AD joined" (for devices connected to on-premises Active Directory) and "Azure AD joined" (for devices directly joined to Azure AD without on-premises AD).
5.  Once you've made the necessary configurations, click "Save" to apply the settings.
    

With these settings in place, users will be able to join their devices to Azure AD as configured. The exact steps for device registration will depend on the device type and operating system being used.

It's important to note that for Hybrid Azure AD join, additional steps are required to set up Azure AD Connect and establish the connection between on-premises AD and Azure AD.

Ensure that you carefully plan and test the Azure AD join configuration to align with your organization's security and compliance requirements.
