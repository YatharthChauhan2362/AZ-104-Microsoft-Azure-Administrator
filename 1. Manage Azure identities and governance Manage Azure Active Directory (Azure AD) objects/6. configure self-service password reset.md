To configure self-service password reset in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com) with your Azure AD administrator account.
2.  In the left-hand menu, select "Azure Active Directory."
3.  In the Azure Active Directory blade, select "Password reset" under the "Security" section.
4.  In the "Password reset" blade, you can configure the following settings:

    - "Registration": Set the users' registration options, such as allowing users to register for self-service password reset or requiring them to provide additional security information during registration.
    - "Authentication methods": Choose the authentication methods that users can use to verify their identity during password reset. Options include email, mobile app notification, and security questions.
    - "Notifications": Configure the notification settings for password reset, such as the email sender name and custom email templates.
    - "Authentication methods" (preview): This new feature allows you to enable and configure additional authentication methods, such as Microsoft Authenticator app, FIDO2 security keys, or SMS verification.
    - "Customization": Customize the branding and helpdesk information for the self-service password reset experience.
    - "Custom banned passwords" (preview): Optionally, you can specify a list of banned passwords that users cannot use.

5.  Make the necessary configurations based on your organization's requirements.
6.  Click "Save" to apply the settings.

Once self-service password reset is configured, users will be able to reset their passwords or unlock their accounts using the specified authentication methods and registration options.

Remember to communicate the self-service password reset feature to your users and provide guidance on how to register and use it effectively.
