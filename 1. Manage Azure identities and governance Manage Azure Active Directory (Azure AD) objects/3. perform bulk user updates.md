To perform bulk user updates in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can use the Azure AD PowerShell module or Microsoft Graph API. Here are the general steps:

Using Azure AD PowerShell:

1.  Install and set up the Azure AD PowerShell module on your local machine.
2.  Open PowerShell and connect to your Azure AD tenant using the following command:
    
    powershell
    
    ```powershell
    Connect-AzureAD
    ```
    
3.  Retrieve the users you want to update. You can use commands like `Get-AzureADUser` with appropriate filters to fetch the user list into a variable.
4.  Modify the user properties in the variable using PowerShell commands or scripts. For example, you can use `Set-AzureADUser` to update specific user properties.
5.  Use a loop or pipeline to apply the changes to all users in the variable.
6.  Once all modifications are made, confirm and apply the changes by running the appropriate command(s) to update the users.

Using Microsoft Graph API:

1.  Acquire an access token with the necessary permissions to manage users in Azure AD.
2.  Use the appropriate API endpoint, such as `GET /users`, to retrieve the list of users you want to update.
3.  Modify the user properties in the response JSON payload.
4.  Make a `PATCH` request to the respective user's endpoint, such as `PATCH /users/{user-id}`, to update the user's properties. Repeat this step for each user you want to update.
5.  Ensure proper error handling and confirm the successful update of each user.

Note: Both methods require administrative permissions and appropriate authentication to access and update user properties in Azure AD. Make sure to carefully test and validate your changes in a non-production environment before performing bulk updates in a production environment.
