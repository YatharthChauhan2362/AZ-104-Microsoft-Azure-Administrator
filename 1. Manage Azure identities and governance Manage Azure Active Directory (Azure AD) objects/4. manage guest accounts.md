To manage guest accounts in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), you can follow these steps:

1.  Sign in to the Azure portal (portal.azure.com) with your Azure AD administrator account.
    
2.  In the left-hand menu, select "Azure Active Directory."
    
3.  In the Azure Active Directory blade, select "Users" and then "All users."
    
4.  In the user list, filter or search for the guest accounts you want to manage.
    
5.  Select the guest account you want to manage.
    
6.  In the guest account's properties page, you can perform various actions:
    
    *   Assign or remove licenses: In the "Licenses and apps" section, you can assign or remove licenses for the guest account, granting them access to specific Microsoft 365 services or applications.
    *   Modify user properties: In the "Profile" section, you can update the guest account's display name, job title, department, and other details.
    *   Reset or change password: In the "Credentials" section, you can reset or change the guest account's password.
    *   Manage group membership: In the "Group memberships" section, you can add or remove the guest account from groups.
    *   Manage application access: In the "Applications and permissions" section, you can manage the guest account's access to Azure AD applications.
7.  Make the necessary changes to the guest account's properties and settings.
    
8.  Click "Save" to apply the modifications.
    

Additionally, you can use Azure AD PowerShell or Microsoft Graph API to manage guest accounts programmatically. These methods provide more flexibility for bulk operations or automation.

Remember to follow your organization's policies and security guidelines when managing guest accounts in Azure AD.
